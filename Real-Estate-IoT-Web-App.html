    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
      <br><br>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">Instead of having a building automation control system, one of our real estate clients wanted a live dashboard that can allow them to see just the live data and also use it like a spreadsheet. They expected to track the energy usage, facility costs, schedule, and several other things. They also needed a way to upload documents such as floorplans into the system. Because our products are usually meant for clients who want full control of their facilities, I had to build a product from scratch, tailored to this use case.</p>
      <br><br>
     <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
      <br><br>
     <p class="project-paragraph">We kicked off the project with a phone meeting with our clients. They walked us through a very rough drough of what they were expecting from my team. However, what they had laid out were the visual aspects of how they wanted the elements laid out but didn't actually give me any details on how users would interact with each element. Also, their mockup was incomplete as they have not fully decided what they wanted in each section. Using their draft, I created my own version of a mockup, depicting a solid userflow. </p>

      <br><br>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
           With the UI team and clients, we went over my lo-fi mock-up and worked out the kinks together. The entire process was long and iterative, as they constantly wanted to change up some of the requirements on the spot. After feeling like I had enough data, I received their permission to start creating a higher quality version to further show the look and feel. I also created an InVision prototype so that the front end engineers had something to work with.

      <h1 class="project-h1">The Challenge</h1>
      
      <br><br>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        The most difficult part of this project was definitely trying to communicate our process to our clients. We walk them through our process, talking about mockups and prototypes, and deadlines. When I sent them a PDF version of the high fidelity mockups, they thought that those were screenshots of their site. Normally when misunderstandings like this happen, we congregate as with our teams, VP, and clients to further discuss the expectations and resources. Our clients sometimes don't understand the approach and methods of our scope, so we have to make sure that we walk them through each step of the process as we present the different phases.
      </p>
      <br>
      
        <p class="project-paragraph">I created two prototypes: one using InVision for the engineers and a DGLux5 version for the client. We weren't using live data as there weren't any coming in yet, but we gave clients access to the software so they can learn how to use it.</p>

      <h1 class="project-h1">The Results</h1>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        
          While the process was rocky with some misunderstandings along the way, it brought some good news in the end. The clients loved the design so much that they wanted to use this UI for all of their properties to some extent. This meant that over 30 properties will be using my design for their building automation needs. It locked Controlco in with more guaranteed projects.
