       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">I was hired at Engagio to help them move away from their omnipresent nautical theme and head towards a cleaner and modern aesthetic. Although the company has a brand guideline, they were struggling with design inconsistencies, especially in their marketing efforts. My job is to refresh the design trends, promote the brand guideline, and give Engagio a stronger visual identity. I'd be responsible for digital ad banners, the website, case study designs, infographics, tradeshow booths and everything else in between.</p>

       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">Each design task starts off with a short kick-off meeting including the Head of Global Demand Gen and sometimes with a member from another department. Specs and requirements are determined at this time using my personal checklist.</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph"> By getting all of the information through this list, I can decide what tools and resources I should use, who I should be asking for further help, and how to budget my time. </p>

      Engagio is an ABM software company, so marketing content is the core of everything here. Each week, we create engagement through emails, social and/or blog posts, webinars, and podcasts. I regularly produce banners for these things but also create other content like infographics and PDF worksheets for our target accounts.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">Before my arrival at Engagio, the company was using a lot of nautical stock photos, turquoise overlays, and Gio the Whale. I limited the use of Gio and designed original content using shapes and colors from our secondary palette to make things more visually appealing. By getting away from the aquatic/fish theme, we opened ourselves up to more options for a modern design. By coming up with custom imagery, we are able to give ourselves a stronger identity as a software company.</p>

      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">In February, Engagio published an eBook called The Clear and Complete Guide to ABM Analytics. It was Marketing's responsibility to promote the content through email banners, social posts, and the website itself. My efforts included designing the eBook spotlight on our homepage as well as the landing page. Using the same assets from the eBook, I created some drafts to present to the team.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">My early mockups were reviewed and had its kinks worked out. In an earlier iteration, I had both buttons aligned vertically, with the Download Guide button white and the Request Demo black. We agreed that the Request Demo button conflicted with the Download Guide button because of the black fill. To establish a hierarchical flow where users are directed towards the Download Guide first, I ended up removing the black fill to make it secondary. </p>

We wanted to incorporate expert testimonies on the landing page because we felt that it would increase our conversion rates and give people trust in our products.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">We currently use Marketo to build out marketing content. While I designed individual components in Adobe and Sketch, I put them together using a pre-built Marketo form template. There was a lot of reiterating for this design before we came up with the final look. The final landing page is live and can be seen <a href="http://info.engagio.com/clear-complete-guide-to-abm-analytics.html?utm_source=home_takeover" target="_blank">here.</a>

    <h1 class="project-h1">The Challenges</h1>
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
          The entire ABM Analytics Guide campaign kept us all very busy, motivated, and excited. It was an exhilarating process that everyone contributed to. There were a few difficulties encountered along the way including balancing multiple design projects. Deadlines got thrusted forward sometimes but I managed everyone's expectations well and was reasonable with the resources and time I needed.</p>
          
          <div class="fortyspace"></div>
         
   
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
          Another temporary obstacle: using Marketo for the first time. Marketo is a very powerful and scalable marketing tool, but ironically, the design studio component of the program was not intuitive and quite difficult to navigate. There was a learning curve, but within an hour, I learned how to create what I wanted. Because the templates we were using were very limited, I used custom HTML/CSS and Adobe-made visuals to spruce up our Marketo pages.
      </p>
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
       <h1 class="project-h1">Testing</h1>
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
          For email content, we did subject line testing using Marketo's built-in system. Our Content Writer and Head of Global Demand are responsible for setting up test samples and sending it out. For the website, we used Google Analytics to see where people were clicking. However, the revenue team realized that they weren't getting any requests for weekly demos 3 days after the homepage went live. It turns out that we removed the button where people normally sign up so that we can utilize the space for the takeover. There is another way for visitors to sign up for these demos through a ubiquitous button that appears on the navbar. The button didn't stand out much though. My solution was to make that button more obvious on the global navbar by changing the color and bolding the text. Within a week, the statistics returned to normal which is about 3-5 requests a week.</p>
          
           <div class="fortyspace"></div>
          
          <img src="../images/engagio-digital-marketing/navbar.png" class="project-image" width="750px"><p class="caption">Originally, the Request Demo wasn't obvious as there was no fill in the button. I made it more noticeable by making it "Tahiti", one of the colors from our palette.</p>
     
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
    
      
    <h1 class="project-h1">Defining Times for Engagio</h1>
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">
        The Clear and Complete Analytics Guide was a complete success. We had over two hundred downloads in the first half of February, which exceeded our expectations. There were huge numbers of conversions coming from our social, email, and blog posts altogether.
        
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        For the most part, everyone was positively receptive of the new designs and styles I was cranking out. Jon Miller, the CEO, specifically liked the testimony templates and gradient usage. He felt that it gave the company a much more modern look. We are going through exciting times at the company, with more customers and more recognition than ever. With Engagio emerging as a leader in ABM technologies, it is my personal goal to give it a strong visual identity to match its impact.
