    <p class="project-paragraph">
      
      I was hired at Engagio to mainly help design visual content to promote their big eBook release. My onboarding was part of a greater effort to move the company away from an omnipresent nautical theme and head towards a cleaner and modern aesthetic. Although the company has a brand guideline, they were struggling with design inconsistencies in their marketing campaigns. My job at Engagio is to refresh the current look, promote the brand guideline, and to provide a stronger visual identity as a software company.

      <p class="project-paragraph">Before my arrival, the company was using a lot of nautical stock photos, turquoise overlays, and Gio the Whale. I limited the use of Gio and designed original content using shapes and colors from our secondary palette to give our look some more “pop". By getting away from the aquatic/fish theme, we opened ourselves up to more options for a modern feel.</p>

      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">In February, Engagio published the aforementioned eBook: The Clear and Complete Guide to ABM Analytics. While we were promoting the release through banners and social posts, we also needed to make a homepage spotlight for the guide, which I spearheaded. I drafted a few versions on Sketch for my team to critique.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">A third draft was compiled as a combination of the first two. While creating this version in Sketch, we made a few adjustments along the way. Having the Download Guide and Request Demo on the same line created a conflict of hierarchy. Since the Download Guide button is the primary CTA, I changed the second button to another line and made it transparent. The black fill is visible on a mouseover event, which I felt would give users more resolve when confronting a transparent button.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">The CEO and marketing team felt that the current landing page was drawl and wanted to spruce things up with customer testimonies. However, the entire template was built in Marketo, a powerful marketing content platform in which I didn’t have the ability to change the layout of. I was able to write some custom HTML/CSS and create graphics- enough to change the feel of the landing page.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
          The entire eBook campaign kept the team very busy, motivated, and excited. It was an exhilarating process that everyone contributed to that came along with a few challenges for myself. It was my first time using Marketo, and while it is regarded as a powerful and scalable marketing tool, the design studio component of the program was not intuitive. It allowed for limited changes in the layout, but by providing my own code and digital assets, I was able to make our landing page more appealing.</p>

       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">
       The Clear and Complete Analytics Guide was a complete success. We had over a thousand downloads in the first month, which exceeded our expectations. There were huge numbers of conversions coming from our social, email, and blog posts altogether.
        
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
        
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Overall, people were positively receptive of the new designs and styles I was cranking out. I was specifically given shoutouts for taking our art direction towards “edginess” and for being able to balance multiple, incredibly different projects at once. We are going through exciting times at the company, with more customers and more recognition than ever. With Engagio emerging as a leader in ABM technologies, it is my personal goal to give it a strong visual identity to match its impact.
