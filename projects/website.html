            The websites we build for our Controlco clients allow access to HVAC and lighting controls, as well as alarms and other system backbones. One of my biggest contributions for Controlco was to completely re-design one of our client's website. It was a massive task because I had to come up with an entirely new interface on my own. While I had a lot of leverage in building the design, it was also challenging having to figure out how to bring in change to a group of users who've been using the same interface for years.
        </p><br><br>

              <h3 class="positiontext">CHALLENGES</h3>
             <p class="blackp">There were several issues that I needed to tackle in building this design. The type of users that we build for are experts in their field—engineers and technicians who've been working in the automation industry for over thirty years. They love their data and would totally be content using excel sheets as an interface if they could. However, because Controlco had to compete with other companies, we had to make our products look up to date. By implementing current design trends and user-friendly processes, we can build better relationships and a bigger clientele. The current website was designed by the CEO before the company even focused on design initiatives, so you can bet it wasn't the most intuitive interface. There were many nuances regarding the current website including dropdown menus for only two selections, and repetitve data. The designing would be easy, but I kept in mind that I was creating something for a resistant bunch.</p>
             
             <p class="pinkp"><i>"How do we introduce new design initiatives to a group of users who've been trained to use the same interface for years? How do I propose to them that my new design will save them more time?"</i></p>
             
             <p class="blackp">My solution was to get direct feedback from our project managers about what information needed to be retained from the current website. I also asked users what aspects on the current design can be improved. This was done through conference calls and Slacking back and forth. I also felt it was appropriate to constantly let users know along the way what changes were going to take place, so that way they had input in my iterations.</p>

            <h3 class="positiontext">APPROACH</h3>
             <p class="blackp">
                 The first step in the re-design process was to go through the current site and figure out what can be improved, according to user input and my own design critique. Aside from the poorly laid out information and crumby color scheme of the current website, I also focused on the user interaction of various pages. I came up with better solutions for dropdown features, table data, and HVAC details.</p>
                 
            <br><br> <img src="../images/websitetype.svg" class="image2">
             <br><br>
             There were a few new concepts I introduced into this design that would make for better usability. On the current site, when users are on the HVAC detail list, clicking an air handler from one of the tables will result in a new page opening. My answer to prevent users from having to go up to click the browser back button was to include a lightbox instead. With this feature, users will be able to effortless switch between HVAC units with minimal mouse movement.  </p> <br><br>
                 
              <img src="../images/lightbox.jpg" class="image"> <div class="caption"><i>Parts of the website that include lightboxes include the HVAC detail page and the schedule page.</i></div>
            <br><br>
                 
                 
             <p class="blackp">
             An element that I believed to be flawed on the old site were the areas where users can select options via dropdown. Even in forms where there were only two choices, the dropdown was the only way for them to choose. It wasn't efficient because there was an unnecessary mouse click involved and users are only able to see their options when they click on the dropdown. My solution: a toggle feature so that users can see their options at first glance and easily switch between the two. </p><br><br>

            <h3 class="positiontext">A NEW GENERATION OF CONTROLCO WEBSITES</h3>
            <p class ="blackp">This particular website was the first to deviate from our previous websites in terms of the design. It was the first opportunity that I was given as a designer and so I had a lot at stake. But after presenting the design to my VP and the clients, they were elated with the outcome. This point in time marked the beginning of new design initiatives for Controlco websites.</p><br><br>
