            One of my freelance projects included re-designing a desktop website for PowerPlug USA. The client wanted to retain the color schematics, but wanted to update their overall design. This assignment differed greatly from my previous projects where I was focused on designing product UI.

             <img src="../images/powerplug1.jpg" class="image"><div class="caption"><i>Visitors can learn more about PowerPlug products and purchase them for select vehicles.</i></div><br><br><br>
             
              <h3 class="positiontext">CHALLENGES</h3>
             <p class="blackp"> I felt that the old interface didn't make good use out of their selected colors. My first impression of the red: it was bright, repulsive, and was taking up 600 pixels in height. There were a few other things that I felt could use some improvements including the global navigation, contact page, and live chat functionality. Below are some screenshots of the website pre-makeover.</p>
             
             <br><br> <img src="../images/powerplug2.jpg" class="imagewithshadow2"> <div class="caption"><i>The current home page. Users are immediately greeted with an enormous static image of the PowerPlug without many other options.</i></div>
             <br><br>
             
             <img src="../images/powerplug3.jpg" class="imagewithshadow2"> <div class="caption"><i>Users are able to look at products when hovering over the link. However, the products are displayed in a tree format in which submenus will appear. There aren't a lot of products, so it was unnecessary to include that extra step to view all products.</i></div>
             <br><br>
             
             <img src="../images/powerplug4.jpg" class="imagewithshadow2"> <div class="caption"><i>Users can chat with staff if they have any questions. However, this can only be accessed through the contact page. I felt that the live chat window should be available on every page, as users are sifting through product information.</i></div>
             <br><br><br>
             
             
       
             
            <h3 class="positiontext">APPROACH</h3>
             <p class="blackp">
                 After outlining the aspects that needed to be fixed, I began brainstorming some solutions. I focused mainly on the layout and architecture of information before focusing on the style. I drew out a few whiteboard flows of my concept website. </p>
                 
            <br><br> <img src="../images/ppsketch1.jpg" class="image"> <div class="caption"><i>The homepage. Once users hover over the products link, a single submenu will appear, showing all of the available products.</i></div>
             <br><br>
             
            <img src="../images/ppsketch2.jpg" class="image2"> <div class="caption"><i>Besides the major changes that I've addressed, I had some other things in mind such as adding more items to the footer to give PowerPlug more of an internet presence. Social media links will be included on here.</i></div>
             <br><br>
             
             <img src="../images/ppsketch3.jpg" class="image2"> <div class="caption"><i>Concept of the contact page. I removed a lot of the contact methods on the left so that way it was more intuitive for users. The live chat feature is no longer on the contact page only.</i></div>
             <br><br>
             
             
             <p class="blackp">
             The next step in the process involved coming up with the usage of colors. I kept the colors as the client wanted, but I rearranged where they would appear on the website. The use of red is often associated with cancellation or deletion, so I changed the red buttons to a different color.  </p> <br><br>

            <h3 class="positiontext">DESIGNING FOR THE BRAND</h3>
            <p class ="blackp">This opportunity allowed me to create something in the marketing sphere instead of my usual product UI design. I learned that focusing on brand design is just as important as the product, as it is the initial liaison between users and products. </p><br><br>
