    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
     
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">Data centers contain complex systems of power and energy. While we were in the midst of building out the software for a few Infomart data centers, we didn't have a blueprint to show the summary of energy between their machines. As one of my first large-scale autonomous projects at Controlco, I was responsible for creating this part of the product.</p>
     
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph"> After the VP of Operations showed me old examples of old energy summary pages, I could easily see why they needed an upgrade badly. This dashboard would be a read-only deliverable where users will not be able to change operational settings. The goal was to create an interface that showed what they wanted, but without overwhelming them with too many tables of IoT data.</p>
     
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <h1 class="project-h1">The Challenge</h1>
    
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">Our clients are used to seeing both real power and apparent power, kW and kVA respectively, for every point. However, they also sectioned these points into three phases, which meant there would be hundreds of points to show. The biggest challenge was coming up with a concept to show all of this data without the clutter. I felt that it wasn't a good idea to show both kW and kVA at once because it was just simply too much data. The engineers claimed that they needed all of these points present at first glance, but I felt that I could come up with a solution to keep it clean. </p>
      
   <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
        <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">I worked closely with my VP of Operations for this project, communicating my idea about showing kW and kVA separately. While he said that the field engineers prefer seeing both units of electrical power, he trusted my idea to try out a different concept anyway. I created a simple wireframe of a single table.</p>
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <img src="../images/infomart-energy-summary-dashboard/infomartmockup.png" class="project-image"><p class="caption"> An example of what the table looks like for each unit.</p>
      
        
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
       <p class="project-paragraph">The data center contains a few power units: power distribution units (PDU), uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and distribution panels. There are several of each unit, and they also contain phases of electrical power (A,B,C). The clients wanted to see a live average as well as a total sum of all units. I met these requirements but also improved the interface from the previous energy summary pages in the following ways:</p>
      
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <ul>
            <li>Each row would be a different color to make it easier to track.</li>
            <li>The sum appears on the right as its own entity because it is the most important value on the page.</li>
            <li>Instead of showing both real and apparent power at once like what the field engineers were used to, I created a toggle which will switch between real and apparent power.</li>
      
        </ul>
     
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      <img src="../images/infomart-energy-summary-dashboard/infomartfinal.png">
      
     <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <img src="../images/infomart-energy-summary-dashboard/switch.gif" width="750px" class="project-image"><p class="caption">The toggle I created to reduce the amount of points a user sees at once. In the actual live version, the toggle highlight has an elastic property as it bounces between both units of power.</p>
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
        <div class="ministyleguide"><img src="../images/infomart-energy-summary-dashboard/infomarttype.svg" width="750px" class="project-image"><p class="caption">The mini style guide used for this project. Because the engineers work in dark data centers, I chose a dark palette to help their eyes adjust. The bit of green used here creates a lot of emphasis on the important values.</p></div>

      <h1 class="project-h1">The Results</h1>
     
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">I went on to develop the product after getting the final approval. In the end, they were fine using a toggle to show the units of power separately. They understood that it wasn't user friendly to have all that data appear at once, but it was just something they were accustomed to. I created the toggle with a smooth transition between the values so that way it wasn't disorienting for users. They called the animation of the bouncing highlight "fancy". This design went on to be the standard for all dashboard summaries for Infomart data centers.</p>
