    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
      
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">One of my redesigns in 2017 came in the form of a website. The company, Power Plug, builds modules for vehicles to deliver improvements over factory tuning such as more horsepower and better throttle response. Their current website has a number of pages full of technical product info, but with how everything was laid out, the information wasn’t as accessible as it could be.</p>
     
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <h1 class="project-h1">Goals</h1>
      
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph"> It was clear that the Power Plug team didn’t have solid ideas in mind besides the fact that they wanted to update the look but keep their company colors prevalent. They knew that their website wasn’t user-friendly, so my goal was to provide an intuitive user experience with an actual flow. I wanted to make sure that all the major elements are within best practices.</p>
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
       <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
     
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">The first thing I did was visit their website and pick apart things that I could improve. There were several problems I wanted to address.</p>
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <ol>
            <li>The homepage was overtaken by a giant picture of the product against a red background but no information/spotlight on the product</li>
            <li>The navigation menu could be improved to show all the products of each vehicle instead of having users sift through each submenu to see what products are available.</li>
            <li>It's impossible to tell if there's an item in the cart because there is no indication on the icon</li>
            <li>Customers can only talk to experts on the contact page via live window which isn't helpful when they have questions from other pages</li>
      </ol>
      
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <p class="project-paragraph">
           My next move was to come up with a few whiteboard sketches of how I wanted to re-imagine the website. At this time, I didn’t concern myself with the colors or typography— just the barebones layout and flow.

      <img src="images/power-plug-website-redesign/ppsketch1.jpg" class="project-image"><p class="caption">Instead of having that giant block of red, I thought that having a smaller block dedicated to the product spotlight would be beneficial. There would be some information, and users can click to learn more.</p>

      <img src="images/power-plug-website-redesign/ppsketch3.jpg" class="project-image"><p class="caption">After using their website for the first time, I realized there was no confirmation or indication that a message was sent. I proposed an idea where some sort of modal will appear to let users know that Power Plug received their message.</p>

       Features I added to the new website:
      </p>
      
      
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <ul>
            <li>Timed carousel that cycles between different highlights accompanied with brief descriptiosn and CTA</li>
            <li>A red dot on the cart to indicate item(s) in the cart</li>
            <li>The global navigation has been expanded to a mega menu where users won't have to delve into a category</li>
            <li>A live chat window is now on every page of the website and can be minimized</li>
            <li>The contact page has been stripped down and includes a confirmation when users send a message</li>
      
        </ul>
