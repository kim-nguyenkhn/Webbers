      Some of my favorite leisure activities include traveling and exploring nature. This icon set is inspired by my love of the Great Outdoors and my passion for new adventures. They're more badges than they are icons, really. They were designed to resemble nature patches and stickers of National Parks. Click <a>here</a> to download this set.

      <p class="project-paragraph">The CEO and marketing team felt that the current landing page was drawl and wanted to spruce things up with customer testimonies. However, the entire template was built in Marketo, a powerful marketing content platform in which I didn’t have the ability to change the layout of. I was able to write some custom HTML/CSS and create graphics- enough to change the feel of the landing page.</p>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
          The entire eBook campaign kept the team very busy, motivated, and excited. It was an exhilarating process that everyone contributed to that came along with a few challenges for myself. It was my first time using Marketo, and while it is regarded as a powerful and scalable marketing tool, the design studio component of the program was not intuitive. It allowed for limited changes in the layout, but by providing my own code and digital assets, I was able to make our landing page more appealing.</p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
       The Clear and Complete Analytics Guide was a complete success. We had over a thousand downloads in the first month, which exceeded our expectations. There were huge numbers of conversions coming from our social, email, and blog posts altogether.
        
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
        
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        Overall, people were positively receptive of the new designs and styles I was cranking out. I was specifically given shoutouts for taking our art direction towards “edginess” and for being able to balance multiple, incredibly different projects at once. We are going through exciting times at the company, with more customers and more recognition than ever. With Engagio emerging as a leader in ABM technologies, it is my personal goal to give it a strong visual identity to match its impact.
