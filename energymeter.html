             <h3 class="positiontext">OBJECTIVE</h3>
          
            
        <p class="blackp">Huge properties like high-rise buildings and data centers have lots of energy circulation, and with that, comes a need for a way to track where it's all going. This is what we call the "energy summary", and is included in the website that we host for our clients. The summary contains information about uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), power distribution units (PDU), meters, and power output. Seeing that we needed fresh visuals and new concepts, my VP issued me with the exciting task to design and develop the summary page.
        </p><br><br><br>
             <img src="images/energy.jpg" class="image"><div class="caption"><i>The information on the dashboard are not editable. Users can only use this page to view data.</i></div><br><br><br>
             
            <h3 class="positiontext">APPROACH</h3>
             <p class="blackp">I was shown a few summary tables that our client used to monitor their systems in the past. I can't show them on here since I'd be violating some NDA terms, but you'll have to take my word when I say it was hard to find what I was looking for in those tables (and it didn't help that they weren't very pretty to look at). However, I was able to decipher what type of data the engineers and technicians were expecting to see.
             <br><br>
                 
         
            
            <p class="blackp">The thing about working in the buildings automation industry is that there's a lot of data and points involved. Tables and graphs have been the most efficient way of showing this type of data so I decided to stick to that route, while adding my own flair to things. My VP wanted to continue using Arial because it was the font being used for all of our equipment graphics. With that handicap, I had to work a little harder to find a way to make sure my design can still stand out. My goal was to have the tables as user-friendly as possible; to make sure the information presented would not overwhelm our clients.</p><br><br><br>

            <br><br><br>
            <h3 class="positiontext">THE CHALLENGE</h3>
            <p class ="blackp">A kilowatt (kW) is a unit of real power while a kilowatt amp (kVa) is a unit of apparent power, and the client wanted to see the energy in both of these units for every point. Easy to do, right? Well, not really. Showing hundreds and hundreds of figures to a user all at once probably isn't the best idea. Instead, I came up with the solution to engineer a toggle function which gave the users the ability to switch from kW to kVa, and vice versa. I included a blue highlight underneath the form of energy currently being viewed and even gave it a slight bounce as it moved between both options. By incorporating this capability, it would keep the tables less tangled and less disorienting. </p><br><br><br>
                <img src="images/energy.gif" class="image"><div class="caption"><i>Users can toggle between kW and kVA.</i></div><br><br><br>
             
             
                <img src="images/energy2.jpg" class="image"><div class="caption"><i>A page heavy with data, but provides exactly what our clients were after.</i></div><br><br><br>
            
            <h3 class="positiontext">A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION</h3><p class="blackp">The best thing to come out of this was being able to present a brand new idea into a company that has been very stagnant in their designs. After this page went live, my VP was much more eager to have me work on older projects to give them a fresh makeover. </p>
