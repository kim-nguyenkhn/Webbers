        <p class="blackp">My biggest project for Controlco was to completely re-design one of our client's website. It was a massive task because I had to come up with an entirely new interface on my own and it would have to accommodate all the heavy data. The websites we host provide access to HVAC and lighting controls, as well as alarms and other settings for the infrastructure. While I'd be giving the current website a huge facelift, it is also important that the new design would retain some sense of familiarity for our end users.
        </p><br><br><br>
             <img src="images/website.png" class="image"><div class="caption"><i>Users access their buildings' integrated system controls through our server.</i></div><br><br><br>
             
            <h3 class="positiontext">APPROACH</h3>
             <p class="blackp">The first thing I had to deal with was figuring out a color scheme. Most of our systems have been using dark colors so I took the leap and designed around a lighter interface. I decided to go with subtle shades of grey and blue/greens, while using a lot of white space. I played around with different color combinations and ran it through the VP of operations. Once the palette and font type were finalized, I started on building the mockup on Sketch.  (INSERT COLOR TYPE)
           <br><br><br>
             There were a few new concepts I introduced into this design that would make for better usability. On the current site, when users are on the HVAC detail list, clicking an air handler from one of the tables will result in a new page opening. My answer to prevent users from having to go up to click the browser back button was to include a lightbox instead. With this feature, users will be able to effortless switch between HVAC units with minimal mouse movement.  </p>

            <br><br>
                 
                 
             <p class="blackp">
             Something that wasn't well thought out on the current site include the form elements. For example, when users are presented with a form where they can select from two options, they choose via a dropdown. This type of method is not efficient for two option selections because there is an unnecessary mouse click involved and users are not able to see the options until they click on the dropdown. I implemented a toggle feature instead so that way users can see their options at first glance and easily switch between the two. </p>
             <img src="images/toggle.png" class="image"><div class="caption"><i>My improved pages with toggle features. The old site used a dropdown for "filter by" on the alarm page. There were 3 options—acknowledged, unacknowledged, acknowledged and unacknowledged. I replaced that dropdown with switches for better usability and less redundancy. Right: There were too many dropdowns in this form so I created toggle features for selections with 3 or fewer options. </i></div>
